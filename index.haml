              \... they probably won't come

              Let's learn you how to make friends for your web site


        %section
          %h2 In your layout
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              Title tags
            %li.fragment
              Should contain your keyword phrases
            %li.fragment
              Add page specific keyword phrases
            %li.fragment
              bad: "ApartmentList | Rent apartments across the United States"
            %li.fragment
              good "56 Top Apartments in San Francisco, CA for Rent ASAP!"
            %li.fragment
              obviously, s/San Francisco/$CITY/

        %section
          %h2 In your layout
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              h1 tags
            %li.fragment
              Should contain your keyword phrases
            %li.fragment
              Add page specific keyword phrases
            %li.fragment
              There should be only
              %i one
              h1 tag/page
            %li.fragment
              bad: "ApartmentList | Rent apartments across the United States"
            %li.fragment
              good "Apartments for rent near San Francisco, CA (61 buildings)"
            %li.fragment
              notice similarities between title and h1?
            %li.fragment
              when in doubt, set title=h1

        %section
          %h2 In your layout
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              meta description
            %li.fragment
              Don't bother keyword phrase stuffing here
            %li.fragment
              One goal: get the user to click through
              %img{ src: 'assets/google-result-snippet.jpg', style: 'width: 100%' }
            %li.fragment
              Destination page should be not be a surprise
            %li.fragment
              i.e. description shouldn't say "rent condos" and then only try to
              sell houses

        %section
          %h2 Landing Pages / Long Tail
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              Build specific landing pages for commonly searched for variations
            %li.fragment
              i.e. CameraLends has /canon, /canon/cameras.
            %li.fragment
              even better would be /canon/cameras/san-francisco
            %li.fragment
              "Rent cameras" might be hard to compete on, even if it brings
              200 visitors/day
            %li.fragment
              The "long tail" in aggregate of "rent canon 5d mark ii san
              francisco", "rent red one los angeles" and others add up

        %section
          %h2 URL Structure
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              Like title and h1 tags, URL tokens imply hints about content
            %li.fragment
              Use semantic naming when possible
            %li.fragment
              bad: '/gear/15'
            %li.fragment
              good: '/gear/canon-5d-mark-ii'
            %li.fragment
              BEST: '/rent/canon-5d-mark-ii/san-francisco/nob-hill'
            %li.fragment
              The practice of adding "slugs" to URLs is very common
            %li.fragment
              Additional benefit: obfuscates auto-increment IDs

        %section
          %h2 Instructing Googlebot
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              sitemap.xml (or collection of sitemaps)
            %li.fragment
              robots.txt for allow/disallow
            %li.fragment
              Why would you disallow?
            %li.fragment
              If you have 100,000 pages but only 50 entry points, you want
              "link juice" concentrated more in the entry points
            %li.fragment
              nofollow / robots.txt disallow will prevent Google from indexing
              low-SEO-value pages or pages that you never want GoogleBot to see

        %section
          %h2 Good Web Practices
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              SEO has a bad rap
            %li.fragment
              Really, it's encouraging good and sane web development practices
            %li.fragment
              Try writing a script that extracts title, h1, and URL for your 50
              top-viewed web pages
            %li.fragment
              Mine was embarassing :)
            %li.fragment
              Really easy to fix, pays for itself over time in free traffic

        %section
          %h2 Backlinks: why should we trust you?
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              Every search engine sucked in the 90s
            %li.fragment
              Google got it right with PageRank
            %li.fragment
              The more web sites that link to you, the higher your
              authority
            %li.fragment
              If web sites link to you for a specific phrase, i.e. 'camera
              rental', then you have higher authority for that phrase
            %li.fragment
              The higher the authority of the domain with the link to you,
              the more weight it carries
            %li.fragment
              One "good" backlink (30+ CF) is better than hundreds of low CF
              scores

        %section
          %h2 Hands on with Market Samurai
          %ul
            %li.fragment
              Keyword phrase exploration/generation
            %li.fragment
              Analyzing SEO value of phrases (general, long tail)
            %li.fragment
              Assessing competition for a particular phrase
            %li.fragment
              Reverse-engineering why your competitors are ranking so high
            %li.fragment
              \... and use that knowledge to increase your own ranking.
